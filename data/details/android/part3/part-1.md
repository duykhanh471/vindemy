# Compose Essentials
This post comprises of lessons from Compose Essentials, including composable functions, basic layouts and state, Material Design, lists.

## Objective
- Learning how to build a simple UI component with declarative functions,
- Work with basic UI elements such as Row and Column, and give state to your app.

## About Jetpack Compose
Jetpack Compose is a modern toolkit for building native Android user interfaces. It simplifies and accelerates UI development by providing a declarative approach to creating UI components. With Jetpack Compose, you can build beautiful, responsive UIs with less code, in less time.

### Key features of Jetpack Compose include:
- Declarative UI: Instead of imperatively manipulating the UI, you declare what the UI should look like based on your app's state. This makes it easier to reason about your code and reduces the amount of boilerplate needed to create complex UIs.
- Composition: Jetpack Compose allows you to break down your UI into smaller, reusable components that can be composed together to create more complex UIs. This promotes code reuse and makes it easier to maintain and update your code.
- State management: Jetpack Compose provides powerful tools for managing your app's state, making it easier to keep your UI in sync with your data.
- Interoperability: Jetpack Compose is designed to work seamlessly with existing Android code, so you can adopt it incrementally without having to rewrite your entire app.
- Animations: Jetpack Compose makes it easy to add animations to your UI, allowing you to create engaging, dynamic experiences for your users.

Overall, Jetpack Compose represents a significant step forward for Android UI development, offering a more efficient, flexible, and intuitive way to build beautiful, performant UIs.
