Kotlin flows are a type that can emit multiple values sequentially, as opposed to suspend functions that return only a single value. Flows are built on top of coroutines and can provide multiple values. A flow is conceptually a stream of data that can be computed asynchronously. The emitted values must be of the same type. For example, a Flow<Int> is a flow that emits integer values. A flow is very similar to an Iterator that produces a sequence of values, but it uses suspend functions to produce and consume values asynchronously. This means, for example, that the flow can safely make a long-running call to a remote server or read a large file without blocking the main thread.

Flows are sequential, meaning that each individual collection of a flow is performed sequentially unless special operators that operate on multiple flows are used. Running different parts of a flow in different coroutines can be helpful from the standpoint of the overall time it takes to collect the flow, especially when long-running asynchronous operations are involved.

Channels, on the other hand, are all about handling a continuous stream of data that might not stop. They're useful for working with hot streams of data. If you need to listen to streams of data from more than a single place, Channel is the choice to go. However, if you're working with cold streams of data, Flows are the way to go.

In summary, Flows are useful for handling cold streams of data, while Channels are useful for handling hot streams of data. Flows are sequential, while Channels are concurrent.

To use Kotlin Flow in an Android app, you can follow these steps:

1. Add the Kotlin coroutines library to your project. You can do this by adding the following line to your app-level build.gradle file:

```implementation 'org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:1.5.2'```

2. Create a flow by defining a function that returns a Flow<T> object. This function should use the `emit()` function to emit values to the flow. For example:

```
fun getNumbers(): Flow<Int> = flow {
    for (i in 1..10) {
        delay(1000)
        emit(i)
    }
}
```

3. Collect the flow in a coroutine. You can use the `collect()` function to collect the values emitted by the flow. For example:

```
lifecycleScope.launch {
    getNumbers().collect { number ->
        Log.d(TAG, "Number: $number")
    }
}
```

This will log the numbers 1 to 10, with a delay of 1 second between each number.

There are also some advanced features of Kotlin Flow that you can use in your Android app, such as StateFlow and SharedFlow. StateFlow is a type of flow that emits the current state and any subsequent updates to its collectors. SharedFlow is a type of flow that can emit values to multiple consumers. These features can be useful for maintaining observable mutable state and handling hot streams of data, respectively. You can find more information on how to use StateFlow and SharedFlow in the official Android Developers documentation.
