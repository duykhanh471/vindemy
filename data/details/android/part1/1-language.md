## Android Programming Languages

All Android applications must be written using Kotlin, Java, and/or C/C++. Kotlin and Java are the primary languages developers use to build Android applications, while C++ is used to write performance-oriented or hardware-based features that use the Java Native Interface  (JNI) to call native functions.

In this section, we’ll discuss Kotlin and Java.

### Java

When Google revealed the [first version of their Android OS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_avwGFsv60U&ab_channel=Google) over a decade ago, they adopted Java as the main language for Android application development.

But why Java? As one of the oldest object-oriented languages, Java is easy to learn and it works well on the [Dalvik virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalvik_(software)), which was inspired by [Java Virtual Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine) (JVM), making it portable for almost any device and operating system. So, when Google began building the Android system, Java was one of the most suitable languages.

### Kotlin

[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) was born from JetBrains. It was initially designed for the [JVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine) environment and combines functional and object-oriented programming. Since its release, Kotlin has become a rising star in Android development and other fields.

Here are a few reasons why Kotlin pairs so well with Android:

-   **Interoperability**: Kotlin is 100% interoperable with Java and supports great interoperability with JVM environments.
-   **Safety**: Android apps that contain Kotlin code are 20% less likely to crash according to [the Android docs](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/first).
-   **Asynchronicity**: Kotlin’s use of [coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) allows it to provide asynchronous (non-blocking) programming support.

In addition to the points above, Google announced their [Kotlin-first approach to Android development](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/first) at Google I/O 2019. Since the announcement, the number of applications built with Kotlin has increased exponentially.

So if you were to start learning Android development now, Kotlin would be a great choice.
